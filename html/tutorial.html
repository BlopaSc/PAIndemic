<h1>How to play</h1>
<h2>Game rules:</h2>
<h3>If you already know how to play you can skip to the <a href="#Interface">interface explanation</a> or <a href="/build/index.html">start a game</a>.</h3>
<p>
If you desire to read the original rule book, it is available <a href="https://images-cdn.zmangames.com/us-east-1/filer_public/25/12/251252dd-1338-4f78-b90d-afe073c72363/zm7101_pandemic_rules.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Game objectives</h3>
<p>
Pandemic is a game in which players must work together to discover the cures to 4 diseases that are ravaging the world.<br>
The four diseases are known by their colors: red, yellow, blue and black. To win the players must discover the cures for all of them.<br>
The game is played on a game board representing a world map with 48 different cities spread throughout the board with different paths connecting them. The cities may get infected by different diseases which are represented by colored cubes in the game board. Players may treat the diseases to remove disease cubes from the cities, or leave them alone, risking the chance of an outbreak happening and the propagation of the disease.<br>
The players will also have access to players' cards (which are drawn at the end of each turn) that allow them to perform a variety of actions and are a requirement to discover the cures for the diseases.<br>
<br>
The players lose the games if any of these three conditions is met:<br>
<ul>
<li>The players' cards deck runs out (the players ran out of time) and a player requires to draw a card</li>
<li>There are more than 24 disease cubes of any color in game (the disease spread too much)</li>
<li>More than 7 outbreaks occurred during the game (a worldwide panic occurred).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Players' turns</h3>
<p>
The game is divided by turns and each turn consists of different phases:<br>
First the current player must perform 4 actions (explained in the next subsection), then if the game hasn't finished the player must draw 2 cards from the players' cards deck, if a player were to have more than 7 cards in their hand then cards must be discarded until there are 7 left; finally, cards are drawn from the infection deck and the specified cities are infected with one disease cube of their respective colors.<br>
The number of cards drawn from the infection deck depend on the current infection rate of the game, which increases after the third and fifth epidemic.<br>
An epidemic happens when an epidemic card is drawn from the players' cards deck. During an epidemic the bottom card of the infection deck is drawn and the specified city gets 3 infection cubes added, then all the cards in the infection deck discard pile are shuffled and added on top of the infection deck.<br><br>
If during the infection phase or during an epidemic a city would add cubes resulting in more than 3 cubes of one specific color in the city, then the amount of cubes in the city is capped at 3 for that color but an outbreak will occur.<br>
During an outbreak all neighboring cities will get one infection cube of the color of the city suffering the outbreak. This can generate an outbreak in those cities, which will create a chain reaction (but cities previously hit by an outbreak chain won't outbreak again).
</p>
<h3>Players' actions</h3>
<p>
As previously stated, during each of their turns the players must perform 4 actions. This actions may vary from player to player depending on their <b>role</b> (which varies from game to game) and also on their available player cards.<br>
Each player has the same 8 basic actions:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Drive/ferry to a city:</b> Drives or takes a ferry to a neighboring city connected to the current one.</li>
<li><b>Direct flight to a city:</b> Flies directly to target city by discarding a player card with its name on it.</li>
<li><b>Charter flight to any city:</b> Flies directly to any city by discarding a player card with the current city's name on it.</li>
<li><b>Shuttle flight to a city:</b> Flies directly to a city if both cities have a research station on them.</li>
<li><b>Build a research station:</b> Build a research station on the current city by discard a player card with its name on it.</li>
<li><b>Treat disease:</b> Remove 1 disease cube of a specified color from the city you are currently in.</li>
<li><b>Share knowledge:</b> Give or receive a card with the current city's name on it to/from another player in the current city.</li>
<li><b>Discover a cure:</b> At a city with a research station, discard 5 cards of the same color to discover the cure for that colored disease.</li>
</ul>
The role of the player also has an impact on the game and the possible actions that can be performed, in the case of this game these are the possible player roles available and their respective effects:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Medic:</b> Removes all cubes of the same color when treating a disease. If a disease has already been cured then it automatically treats the disease when entering the city without consuming an action.</li>
<li><b>Quarantine specialist:</b> Prevents outbreaks and the placing of cubes in its current city and all cities connected to it, except during setup.</li>
<li><b>Researcher:</b> May give any city card to other players in the same city (in any of their turns).</li>
<li><b>Scientist:</b> Only requires four player cards of the same color (instead of five) to discover a cure for a disease.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Interface">Game interface:</h2>
<h3>If you already know the interface you can skip this section and <a href="/build/index.html">start a game</a>.</h3>
<h3>Starting the game</h3>
<p>
When you start playing a new game, the browser will automatically load the WebGL Player but this may take some time depending on your Internet connection (~10 seconds in a 10Mbit/s connection).<br>
If this does not happen please verify that your browser and the web page have the requirements and permissions needed to run WebGL applications.<br>
The game will automatically load, entering directly into your new game. This game is not saved in your computer in any way and if the web page is reloaded then a new game will start.<br>
Also keep in mind that idle games (>30 minutes since the last action) are removed from the server and will not be accessible.<br><br>
Once a game starts, the game will show the world map similar to the following image:<br><br>
</p>
<img src="/images/screenshot1.jpg" width="60%"/><br><br>
<p>
If the game layout shows a "Thinking..." message in red, it means the game started on the computer's turn and the turn is being processed; but your turn will start shortly!<br>
If for some reason the game couldn't contact the server (or if your game stopped existing) an error message would appear.<br>
</p>

<h3>Keeping track of the game</h3>
<p>
Learning to keep track of what's happening is important to success.<br>
The game has a series of animations which play after each specific action or event to help keeping track of what is happening. These icons will appear in the game when a specific event happens:<br><br>
</p>
<table width="40%">
<tr>
<th width="70px">Icon</th>

<p>
Any card exchanges (through sharing knowledge), card discard and player movement will be presented in the game with the visual movement of the cards and the players' pawns/meeples. 
</p>
<h3>Interacting with the game</h3>
<p>
Performing an action is perhaps the most crucial step in controlling the interface: at any given moment you will be either waiting for the AI to perform its action or the game client will be expecting you to perform an action.<br>
There are two main turn phases in which you will be requested to perform an action:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>ACTIONS phase:</b> During this phase your possible actions will be signaled by a glowing halo surrounding some of the cities of the map (including your own in some cases) and sometimes by a glowing halo surrounding one of your or the computer's cards.</li>
<li><b>DISCARD phase:</b> During this phase your possible actions will be signaled by a glowing halo surrounding only your cards.</li>
</ul>
The glowing halo effect allows you to know which objects can be interacted with and will have at least one possible action available to be execute. You can click on any of them and the action menu will appear allowing you to pick the action you want to perform among a list of available options.
</p>
<h4>Examples of the glowing halo</h4>
<table>
<tr><th>City</th><th>Card</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="/images/glow_city.jpg" height="100px"/></td><td><img src="/images/glow_card.jpg" height="100px"></td></tr>
</table>
<h3>End of game and beyond</h3>
<p>
After you have finished the game (shown by a message informing you of your victory or defeat) you will be asked to fill out a survey or skip it if you don't wish to participate. If you choose to participate in the survey you will answer a few questions about your experience and then will go to the credits, were you may choose to play again if you like. If you choose to not participate in the survey you will be taken directly to the credits were you can choose to play again.
